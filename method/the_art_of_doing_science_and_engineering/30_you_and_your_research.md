### 目前为止我不知道什么

- 没有明确的职业规划，不知道自己适合哪个发展方向

### 这篇文章的主要内容是什么

- Luck favors the prepared mind

- set high goals and accomplish them

> Thus in a real sense I am preaching the message:
> (1) it is worth trying to accomplish the goals you set yourself,
> (2) it is worth setting yourself high goals.

- do important things

> Among the important properties to have is the belief you can do important things.
> If you do not work on important problems how can you expect to do important work?
>
> I began by asking what the important problems were in chemistry,
> then later what important problems they were working on,
> and finally one day said, “If what you are working on is not important and not likely to lead to important things, then why are you working on it?”

- working condition

> What you consider to be good working conditions may not be good for you!
>
> I suspect the open mind leads to the open door, and the open door tends to lead to the open mind; they reinforce each other.
>
> when stuck often inverting the problem, and realizing the new formulation is better, represents a significant step forward.
>
> All these stories show the conditions you tend to want are seldom the best ones for you—
> the interaction with harsh reality tends to push you into significant discoveries which otherwise you would never have thought about while doing pure research in a vacuum of your private interests.

- drive

> Looking around you can easily observe great people have a great deal of drive to do things.

- intellectual investment

> Intellectual investment is like compound interest,
> the more you do the more you learn how to do, so the more you can do, etc.
> I do not know what compound interest rate to assign, but it must be well over 6%—
> one extra hour per day over a lifetime will much more than double the total output.
> The steady application of a bit more effort has a great total accumulation.

- ask the larger questions

> At the urging of others, for some years I set aside Friday afternoons for “great thoughts”.
> Of course I would answer the telephone, sign a letter, and such trivia,
> but essentially, once lunch started, I would only think great thoughts—
> what was the nature of computing,
> how would it affect the development of science,
> what was the natural role of computers in Bell Telephone Laboratories,
> what effect will computers have on AT&T, on Science generally?
> I found it was well worth the 10% of my time to do this careful examination of where computing was heading so I would know where we were going and hence could go in the right direction.
>
> I strongly recommend this taking the time, on a regular basis, to ask the larger questions
> and not stay immersed in the sea of detail where almost every one stays almost all of the time.

- style
  - The essence of the book is “style”
  - The content of these chapters is “style” of thinking
  - Pick out those parts you can adapt to your life as you plan it to be

> You need to work on the right problem at the right time and in the right way—
> what I have been calling “style”.
>
> Doing the job with “style” is important.
> As the old song says, “It ain’t what you do it's the way that you do it”.
> Look over what you have done, and recast it in a proper form—
> by presenting it in its basic, fundamental form,
> it may have a larger range of application than was first thought possible.

- "selling" new ideas
  - giving formal presentations
  - producing written reports
  - master the art of informal presentations as they happen to occur

### 这篇文章的知识本质是什么

作者在这篇文章的结尾说到，整本书的本质就是做事风格（style）。
而作者的做事风格是：做大事、想大问题、开放创新、勤奋

### 这篇文章的知识第一原则是什么

作者在这篇文章的开头说到，他想传递的信息是：制定大目标并努力实现它。

### 这篇文章的知识结构是什么

- 运气：机会只垂青有准备的人
- 智力：做大事不一定需要很高的智力（达到一定水平即可）
- 自信：相信自己能够做大事、追求卓越
- 工作环境
  - 开发的工作环境能让你保持开发的心态
  - 恶劣的现实条件往往可以激励你取得重要的发现或创新（没有？那就造一个）
  - 转化问题
- 动力：智力投资如同复利利率，量变导致质变
- 风格：星期五下午思考重要的想法（提出大问题）
- 容忍不确定性
  - 能够发现改进的空间
  - 有10到20个重要但悬而未决的问题
- 推销自己的想法：开头、中间和结尾有3个笑话

### 这篇文章对我有什么启发和帮助

作者的四点做事风格都很值得我学习：

- 做大事：明确自己认为重要的事情，并制定目标
- 想大问题：每周固定一个时间段来思考大问题，比如周五晚上（如果没空就改为周末晚上）
- 开放创新：造轮子、转化问题
- 勤奋：智力投资的复利利率超过6%
