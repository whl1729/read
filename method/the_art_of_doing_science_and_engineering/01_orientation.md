# The Art of Doing Science and Engineering 分析笔记

## 1 Orientation

### 第1章讨论什么话题

- 介绍本书的定位和写作目的
  - 引导读者创建自己的未来图景，制定远大目标
  - 介绍思考的风格

### 第1章的主要内容是什么

- Purpose
  - The purpose of this course is to prepare you for your technical future.
  - Style of thinking is the center of the course.
  - I will examine, criticize, and display styles of thinking.

> 伍注：作为程序员，我常常说编程风格、文档风格等，其实思考也有风格，做事也有风格。
> 我需要反思自己思考和做事的风格。

- Know what to do and how to do it

> Education is what, when, and why to do things, Training is how to do it.
> Either one without the other is not of much use.
> You need to know both what to do and how to do it.

- The growth of new knowledge
  - You must **concentrate on fundamentals**, at least what you think at the time are fundamentals,
  - and also develop the ability to **learn new fields** of knowledge when they arise so you will not be left behind

> It is well known that since about Isaac Newton’s time (1642–1727) knowledge of the type we are concerned with has about doubled every 17 years.
>
> Both the science and the engineering you will need for your future will more and more often be created after you left school.
> You will simply have to actively master on your own the many new emerging fields as they arise, without having the luxury of being passively taught.
>
> 伍注：刘未鹏提的学习三大问题的第一个就是弄清知识的本质。

- The obsolescence of knowledge

> It is claimed by many the half-life of the technical knowledge you just learned in school is about 15 years—
> in 15 years half of it will be obsolete
> (either we have gone in other directions or have replaced it with new material).

- Back of the envelop calculations
  - You get a good feeling for the truth or falsity of what was claimed
  - Having done the calculation you are much more likely to retain the results in your mind
  - When you hear quantitative remarks you can turn to a quick modeling to see if you believe what is being said

- How are you to recognize “fundamentals”?
  - One test is they have lasted a long time.
  - Another test is from the fundamentals all the rest of the field can be derived by using the standard methods in the field.

- Science vs Engineering
  - In science if you know what you are doing you should not be doing it.
  - In engineering if you do not know what you are doing you should not be doing it.

- The drunken sailor Story
  - Without direction: `sqrt(n)`
  - With direction: `kn`
  - No vision, not much of a future.

- In forming your plan for your future you need to distinguish three different questions:
  - What is possible? (Science)
  - What is likely to happen? (Engineering)
  - What is desirable to have happen? (Ethics, morals)

> For many years I devoted about 10% of my time (Friday afternoons) to trying to understand what would happen in the future of computing,
> both as a scientific tool and as shaper of the social world of work and play.

- Live a meaningful life

> with apparently only one life to live on this earth,
> you ought to try to make significant contributions to humanity rather than just get along through life comfortably—
> that the life of trying to achieve excellence in some area is in itself a worthy goal for your life.
>
> The unexamined life is not worth living. (Socrates)

### 第1章的知识本质是什么

思维风格。包括如何思考问题、如何学习知识和如何制定目标等。

### 第1章的知识结构是怎样的

- 思维风格很重要
- 使用估算和数学建模判断真假
- 应对知识爆炸时代：扎实基础、主动学习新知识
- 制定重要的目标

### 第1章对我有什么启示和帮助

- 要培养好的思维习惯。（作为一个技能来练习）
- 平时看到一些数据时尝试使用估算来判断真伪
- 扎实基础（关于计算机的基础知识，自己需要补充的有编译原理、操作系统、计算机图形学等）
- 主动学习新知识
- 制定重要的目标，做重要的事情
