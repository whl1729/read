#### 34.0 Key Points

- One primary goal of programming is managing complexity.
- The programming process significantly affects the final product.
- Team programming is more an exercise in communicating with people than in communicating with a computer.
  Individual programming is more an exercise in communicating with yourself than with a computer.
- When abused, a programming convention can be a cure that's worse than the disease.
  Used thoughtfully, a convention adds valuable structure to the development environment and helps with managing complexity and communication.
- Programming in terms of the problem rather than the solution helps to manage complexity.
- Paying attention to intellectual warning signs like the "irritation of doubt" is especially important in programming
  because programming is almost purely a mental activity.
- The more you iterate in each development activity, the better the product of that activity will be.
- Dogmatic methodologies and high-quality software development don't mix.
  - Fill your intellectual toolbox with programming alternatives, and improve your skill at choosing the right tool for the job.
