#### 33.0 Key Points

- Your personal character directly affects your ability to write computer programs.
- The characteristics that matter most are
  humility, curiosity, intellectual honesty, creativity and discipline, and enlightened laziness.
- The characteristics of a superior programmer have almost nothing to do with talent and
  everything to do with a commitment to personal development.
- Surprisingly, raw intelligence, experience, persistence, and guts hurt as much as they help.
- Many programmers don’t actively seek new information and techniques and
  instead rely on accidental, on-the-job exposure to new information.
  - If you devote a small percentage of your time to reading and learning about programming,
    after a few months or years you’ll dramatically distinguish yourself from the programming mainstream.
- Good character is mainly a matter of having the right habits.
  - To be a great programmer, develop the right habits and the rest will come naturally.
